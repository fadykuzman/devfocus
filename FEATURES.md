## Focus Timer for Developers


A simple and effective focus timer designed specifically for developers to enhance productivity and focus during software development tasks. It is non-intrusive and easy to use, allowing developers to set focused work intervals and break times.  

### Key Design Aspects
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Clean design. Timer is always visible but does not obstruct workflow
- Timer dominates the screen when active, but minimizes to a small icon when not in use

### Core Features (MUST HAVE)
- [x] A focus count-down timer that has a default value of 40 minutes. 
- [ ] A break count-down timer that has a default value of 10 minutes.
- [x] Start, pause, and reset functionality for focus timers.
- [ ] Start, pause, and reset functionality for break timers.
- [ ] 

### Developer Features (SHOULD HAVE)
- Ability to customize focus and break durations.
- Suggested keyboard shortcuts.
- Suggested times for different activities (e.g. coding, meetings, reading, debugging, codereview, etc.). Do a research from literature and studies and developer surveys to find optimal times for different activities.

### COULD HAVE

### WON'T HAVE

### Future considerations
- Default behavior for timer completion is stop at 00:00.
- Option for timer completion for focus/break to run in negative time, calculated as total with details of overtime (e.g. set to 40 mins, overtime 5 minutes, total session 45 minutes).
- Option for timer completion for focus/break to auto-start to next mode.
- Show the projected daily tasks on a timeline. Adaptable manually - each focus/break/meeting can be draggable and exchangeable - or adapted automatically from calendar or activity tracking.
- plugin for VSCode / Vim / IntelliJ / Figma(?)
