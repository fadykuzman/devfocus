## Focus Timer for Developers


A simple and effective focus timer designed specifically for developers to enhance productivity and focus during software development tasks. It is non-intrusive and easy to use, allowing developers to set focused work intervals and break times.  

### Key Design Aspects
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Clean design. Timer is always visible but does not obstruct workflow
- Timer dominates the screen when active, but minimizes to a small icon when not in use

### Core Features (MUST HAVE)
- [x] A focus count-down timer that has a default value of 40 minutes.
- [x] A break count-down timer that has a default value of 10 minutes.
- [x] Start, pause, and reset functionality for focus timers.
- [x] Start, pause, and reset functionality for break timers.
- [ ] Notifications when focus or break time is over (sound and browser notification)
- [ ] Timer completion handling - timer stops at 00:00 with clear completion state
- [ ] Basic session tracking - count of completed focus and break sessions
- [ ] Persist timer state across browser sessions and page refreshes
- [ ] Basic timer customization - ability to adjust focus and break durations
- [ ] Essential keyboard shortcuts (space for start/pause, R for reset, F for focus, B for break)
- [ ] Clear visual states for timer status (running, paused, completed, idle)
- [ ] Error recovery - handle browser refresh, tab close, system sleep gracefully
- [ ] Responsive design - works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Offline functionality - timer operates without internet connection

### SHOULD HAVE
## General Features
- [ ] Advanced customization - custom timer presets and saved configurations
- [ ] Option to Snooze the timer
- [ ] Option to let the timer run even when set duration is over
- [ ] Detailed statistics and session history (local first)
- [ ] Advanced session analytics - productivity patterns, average session lengths

## Developer Features
- [ ] Advanced keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys
- [ ] Activity-specific timer suggestions (coding, meetings, reading, debugging, code review)
- [ ] Integration with development tools and IDEs
- [ ] Suggested optimal times based on research and developer surveys

### COULD HAVE
- Offer different themes/color palettes
- Dark Mode
- Scenes (Rising sun, dolphins swimming, ...)

### WON'T HAVE

### Future considerations
- Default behavior for timer completion is stop at 00:00.
- Option for timer completion for focus/break to run in negative time, calculated as total with details of overtime (e.g. set to 40 mins, overtime 5 minutes, total session 45 minutes).
- Option for timer completion for focus/break to auto-start to next mode.
- Show the projected daily tasks on a timeline. Adaptable manually - each focus/break/meeting can be draggable and exchangeable - or adapted automatically from calendar or activity tracking.
- plugin for VSCode / Vim / IntelliJ / Figma(?)
