## Focus Timer for Developers


A simple and effective focus timer designed specifically for developers to enhance productivity and focus during software development tasks. It is non-intrusive and easy to use, allowing developers to set focused work intervals and break times.  

### Key Design Aspects
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Clean design. Timer is always visible but does not obstruct workflow
- Timer dominates the screen when active, but minimizes to a small icon when not in use

### Key Features
- A focus count-down timer that has a default value of 40 minutes. 
- A break count-down timer that has a default value of 10 minutes.
- Start, pause, and reset functionality for both timers.
- Ability to customize focus and break durations.

### Future considerations
- Default behavior for timer completion is stop at 00:00.
- Option for timer completion for focus/break to run in negative time, calculated as total with details of overtime (e.g. set to 40 mins, overtime 5 minutes, total session 45 minutes).
- Option for timer completion for focus/break to auto-start to next mode.
