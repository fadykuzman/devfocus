## **Phase 2: Unified Control Component**
*Goal: Consolidate play/pause/reset into single elegant control*

### Component Architecture
- [ ] Create UnifiedControl component interface and props
- [ ] Design state morphing logic (idle → active → paused → reset)
- [ ] Implement circular button design (80px desktop, 60px mobile)
- [ ] Add smooth state transition animations
- [ ] Create long-press reset functionality (2-second hold)
- [ ] Add visual feedback for different states

### Integration & Migration
- [ ] Update Timer component to use UnifiedControl
- [ ] Remove separate PlayPauseButton and ResetButton usage
- [ ] Maintain existing component exports for backward compatibility
- [ ] Update all existing test references
- [ ] Preserve all existing functionality and props

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] Implement spacebar for play/pause toggle
- [ ] Add 'R' key for reset functionality
- [ ] Add 'M' key for minimize (prepare for Phase 3)
- [ ] Add Escape key for exit minimized state
- [ ] Ensure keyboard shortcuts work with screen readers

### Testing for Phase 2
- [ ] Write comprehensive UnifiedControl component tests
- [ ] Test all state transitions (idle → active → paused → reset)
- [ ] Verify long-press reset functionality
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcut implementations
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, focus management)
- [ ] Test touch gestures on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing Timer functionality
- [ ] Test component integration with existing timer hook

## **Phase 3: Minimize/Maximize Feature**
*Goal: Add floating corner functionality and advanced interactions*

### State Management Enhancement

- [ ] Implement minimize/maximize transition logic
- [ ] Add state persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Handle multi-monitor positioning edge cases

### Minimize Control Component
- [ ] Create MinimizeControl component (top-right corner)
- [ ] Implement hover-only visibility (opacity: 0 → 0.7)
- [ ] Add smooth opacity transitions (200ms ease)
- [ ] Create minimize/maximize animations (400ms ease-out)
- [ ] Add position memory and edge magnetism

### Floating Timer State
- [ ] Design 120px circular floating indicator
- [ ] Implement corner positioning with safe margins
- [ ] Add floating timer interactivity (click to restore)
- [ ] Create smooth morphing animations between states
- [ ] Handle z-index layering for overlay scenarios

### Advanced Interactions
- [ ] Add double-tap to minimize (mobile)
- [ ] Implement swipe gestures for mobile minimize
- [ ] Add proximity-based control visibility (desktop)
- [ ] Create smart positioning that avoids covering content
- [ ] Add shake gesture to reset (mobile - optional)

### Cross-Platform Optimization
- [ ] Test floating behavior across different screen sizes
- [ ] Implement proper mobile background operation
- [ ] Add Picture-in-Picture mode support (mobile)
- [ ] Test multi-monitor edge case handling
- [ ] Verify battery optimization on mobile devices

### Testing for Phase 3
- [ ] Test minimize/maximize state transitions
- [ ] Verify position persistence across sessions
- [ ] Test floating timer functionality
- [ ] Verify edge magnetism and smart positioning
- [ ] Test all advanced gestures and interactions
- [ ] Ensure floating timer doesn't interfere with other content
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Verify accessibility in minimized state
- [ ] Performance tests for animation smoothness
- [ ] Test memory usage during extended sessions
