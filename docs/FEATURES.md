## Focus Timer for Developers


A simple and effective focus timer designed specifically for developers to enhance productivity and focus during software development tasks. It is non-intrusive and easy to use, allowing developers to set focused work intervals and break times.  

### Key Design Aspects
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Clean design. Timer is always visible but does not obstruct workflow
- Timer dominates the screen when active, but minimizes to a small icon when not in use

### Core Features (MUST HAVE)
- [x] A focus count-down timer that has a default value of 40 minutes.
- [x] A break count-down timer that has a default value of 10 minutes.
- [x] Start, pause, and reset functionality for focus timers.
- [x] Start, pause, and reset functionality for break timers.
- [ ] Notifications when focus or break time is over (sound and browser notification)
- [ ] Timer completion handling - timer stops at 00:00 with clear completion state
- [ ] Basic session tracking - count of completed focus and break sessions
- [ ] Persist timer state across browser sessions and page refreshes
- [ ] Basic timer customization - ability to adjust focus and break durations
- [ ] Essential keyboard shortcuts (space for start/pause, R for reset, F for focus, B for break)
- [ ] Clear visual states for timer status (running, paused, completed, idle)
- [ ] Error recovery - handle browser refresh, tab close, system sleep gracefully
- [ ] Responsive design - works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Offline functionality - timer operates without internet connection

### SHOULD HAVE
## General Features
- [ ] Advanced customization - custom timer presets and saved configurations
- [ ] Option to Snooze the timer
- [ ] Option to let the timer run even when set duration is over
- [ ] Detailed statistics and session history (local first)
- [ ] Advanced session analytics - productivity patterns, average session lengths

## Developer Features
- [ ] Advanced keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys
- [ ] Activity-specific timer suggestions (coding, meetings, reading, debugging, code review)
- [ ] Integration with development tools and IDEs
- [ ] Suggested optimal times based on research and developer surveys

### COULD HAVE
- Offer different themes/color palettes
- Dark Mode
- Scenes (Rising sun, dolphins swimming, ...)

### WON'T HAVE

### Future considerations
- Default behavior for timer completion is stop at 00:00.
- Option for timer completion for focus/break to run in negative time, calculated as total with details of overtime (e.g. set to 40 mins, overtime 5 minutes, total session 45 minutes).
- Option for timer completion for focus/break to auto-start to next mode.
- Show the projected daily tasks on a timeline. Adaptable manually - each focus/break/meeting can be draggable and exchangeable - or adapted automatically from calendar or activity tracking.
- plugin for VSCode / Vim / IntelliJ / Figma(?)
- Adaptive focus time duration based on historical user data and productivity patternsk
- Choose between timer and flowtime
- if tracks code, observe what repititve tasks a user does, and suggest to automate them with scripts/macros

## Most important features for developers
1.  Automatic tracking with zero manual intervention. Set and forget.
2. IDE specific insights. like WakaTime.
3. minimal distractions and clean interfaces
4. Privacy first options with local storage offer local only with encrypted backup, hosting on a dedicated server or maybe self-hosting but with locked options for paying users only.
5. Offline functionality
6. Gamification done right. Forest is a good example
7. better automatic tracking without manual categorization—specifically, auto-detecting projects from file paths, Git repositories, and IDE context rather than requiring users to manually create and select projects.
8. Flexible timer durations
9. Better data export and analysis interests developers who want to analyze their own patterns: "I wish there were a way to bulk export the raw data in spreadsheet form, just because I'm a bit of a data nerd." CSV exports, API access, and ability to analyze trends over time would enable developers to build custom dashboards and integrate with personal productivity systems.
10. IDE integration for all apps represents an unmet need. While WakaTime owns this category, users want Pomodoro timers and focus modes integrated directly into development environments rather than separate applications. Toggl Track's integration that "adds a start timer button into tools like Jira, Asana, GitHub or Trello" points toward this direction, but no tool successfully combines automatic project detection from IDE 
11. Hybrid manual/automatic modes would provide automatic tracking as a safety net while allowing manual timers for specific deep work sessions, but no current tool bridges this gap effectively.
12. Better mobile-desktop sync
13. break reminders with intelligence—detecting when you're already away from your computer rather than nagging during existing breaks—would make forced break systems less annoying.
14. Account for recovery needs: An extraordinarily honest Hacker News post reveals the dark side of productivity optimization that academic research and marketing materials typically ignore. A solo founder developer described his pattern: "I've been trapped in a brutal cycle: intense flow state with ultra high productivity followed by total burnout. I'd work 16-hour days, feel like a god, ship amazing things, and then crash for weeks, feeling depressed and anxious, unable to even look at code. My relationships would suffer, my health would tank. I tried everything: timers, discipline, willpower, blocking apps, therapy sessions, improving emotion intelligence, fixing life and patterns, etc. Nothing worked." This cycle appears absent from most productivity literature, yet his post resonated with hundreds of developers who recognized the pattern in themselves.
His breakthrough came from distinguishing two types of flow state rather than treating all focused work as equivalent. "Builder's high"—the flow state achieved while coding and solving complex problems—functions as high-calorie flow that drains energy and depletes neurotransmitters. "Player's high"—flow achieved through physical activities like biking, skiing, or climbing—provides nutrient-dense flow that rebuilds capacity. He explained: "One builds my product, but the other rebuilds me. For the first time, it feels like I have a sustainable way to be a developer in flow without destroying my life." This mental model challenges productivity tools that maximize coding time without accounting for recovery needs.

15. Calendar integration matters more when meeting schedules vary daily and family obligations intersect with work hours. Smart notification management that distinguishes true emergencies from routine messages becomes critical when asynchronous communication norms mean dozens of non-urgent pings daily. Environmental awareness—detecting whether the developer is actively at their desk versus away—would prevent awkward situations where timers count empty chair time or break reminders nag during legitimate away periods. The research suggests that 

## Other important considerations
1. Separation between junior, mid-level and senior developers. 
Junior developers often benefit from more structure—Pomodoro intervals, explicit task breakdowns, and external accountability—because they're simultaneously learning both the domain and their own work patterns.
Mid-level developers need productivity systems that handle context switching between projects rather than single-task focus—a requirement current tools largely ignore.
Senior developers need more structure to avoid long sessions that can cause physical pain and mental fatigue.

## Why other tools fail developer
1. Flow state disruption
2. System overhead ranks second among abandonment reasons. Managing the productivity tool itself becomes a chore that detracts from actual work. Users cited excessive configuration options, complex interfaces, and frequent updates as sources of friction. One user lamented, "I spent more time fiddling with the app settings than actually working." Developers want tools that "just work" out of the box with minimal setup and maintenance.

3. Mismatch with work reality causes abandonment when rigid systems collide with unpredictable development work. Bugs don't respect 25-minute time boxes. Production incidents interrupt planned deep work. Code review requests arrive mid-session. One developer explained: "Coding tasks vary in complexity and often don't atly fit into 25-minute intervals. Some tasks might require prolonged uninterrupted focus, while others are shorter and more straightforward."  Systems that penalize or create friction around legitimate interruptions—requiring timer resets, marking "failed" pomodoros, or losing streak counts—generate timer anxiety and guilt that eventually outweigh any productivity benefits.

4. Organizational and environmental barriers defeat individual productivity systems regardless of quality. Open offices, meeting-heavy cultures, and "always-on" expectations render personal productivity methods moot. One developer noted: "One study found an average of almost 87 interruptions per day" for knowledge workers. No personal timer system survives 87 daily interruptions. Developers working in these environments report that focus time optimization occurs at the team and organizational level through cultural changes like "No Meeting Wednesdays," protected focus blocks on shared calendars, and async-first communication norms—not through individual tool adoption. The Gartner research showing that teams with high-quality developer experience are twice as likely to retain developers suggests environmental factors trump individual productivity techniques. Provide ways to be able to present to management how distractions and interruptions are impacting productivity.
