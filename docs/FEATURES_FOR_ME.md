# DevFocus: Personal Feature Specification

*Based on personal interview and workflow analysis*

## Your Core Problem Statement

**Primary Goal**: Achieve longer, uninterrupted flow sessions during development work

**Key Pain Points Identified**:
- Cannot effectively track time spent on different tasks
- Existing timers break flow state rather than preserving it
- 2-7 minute recovery time after interruptions to remember context
- Need to support variable task lengths (30 minutes to full day)
- Multiple IDE environments (nvim, IntelliJ, VSCode)
- Mixed work types: coding, research, documentation, meetings

**Success Metric**: Longer flow sessions with better time tracking and faster context recovery
