# DevFocus: High-ROI Development Roadmap

*Ruthlessly prioritized by development effort vs. workflow impact*

## ROI Analysis: Your Core Pain Points

Based on your interview, these are the **highest ROI** problems to solve:

1. **"I cannot track my time, how much I spend on tasks"** → **Manual tracking is broken, need automatic**
2. **"I want longer flow sessions"** → **Need flow-preserving timer, not Pomodoro interruptions**
3. **"2-7 minute recovery time after interruptions"** → **Context restoration is critical**
4. **"Multi-IDE workflow (nvim, IntelliJ, VS Code)"** → **Cross-IDE session continuity**

## Critical Success Metrics

**Week 1 Success**: Can track one full development session automatically in VS Code
**Month 1 Success**: Have clear data on where your time actually goes
**Month 2 Success**: Measurably faster context recovery after interruptions
**Month 3 Success**: AI insights that actually change how you work

## Phase 1: MVP Flow Timer (Week 1-2)
**ROI: CRITICAL** | **Effort: Low** | **Impact: Immediate**

### Core Goal: Replace current Pomodoro with working flow timer

#### **1.1 Go Backend Essentials** (2-3 days)
```go
// Minimal viable backend
- HTTP server on :8080
- SQLite database (sessions table only)
- POST /sessions/start
- PUT /sessions/activity
- GET /sessions/current
- Basic session tracking (start time, duration, project)
```

**ROI Justification**: Without backend, no data collection = no insights

#### **1.2 VS Code Extension MVP** (2-3 days)
```typescript
// Minimal viable extension
- Status bar showing elapsed time
- Auto-start timer when VS Code opens
- Auto-pause when VS Code loses focus
- Project detection from workspace folder
- Send heartbeats to Go backend
```

**ROI Justification**: This solves your #1 problem - automatic time tracking

#### **1.3 Basic Web Dashboard** (1-2 days)
```typescript
// Evolve current React codebase
- Replace countdown timer with session history
- Show today's sessions and total time
- Project time breakdown (simple bar chart)
- Remove Pomodoro UI, add flow timer display
```

**ROI Justification**: Finally see where your time actually goes

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- ✅ Can work full day with automatic session tracking
- ✅ See accurate time per project/task breakdown
- ✅ Zero manual timer management
- ✅ Flow sessions aren't interrupted by forced breaks

## Phase 2: Cross-IDE + Context + Terminal (Week 3-4)
**ROI: HIGH** | **Effort: Medium** | **Impact: Workflow Game-Changer**

### Core Goal: Handle your multi-IDE workflow + reduce context switching pain + capture terminal work

#### **2.1 Session Continuity Across IDEs** (3-4 days)
```go
// Backend enhancements
- Track IDE type per session
- Handle seamless VS Code → nvim transitions
- Aggregate time across multiple IDEs for same project
- Detect project switching vs IDE switching
```

**ROI Justification**: Your workflow involves multiple IDEs - this makes tracking accurate

#### **2.2 Context Preservation** (3-4 days)
```typescript
// VS Code extension enhancement
- Capture current file + line number on focus loss
- Store in backend with timestamp
- Show "Resume: UserService.java line 145" when returning
- Track interruption duration and recovery time
```

**ROI Justification**: Solves your **2-7 minute recovery problem** - massive productivity gain

#### **2.3 nvim Plugin (Basic)** (2-3 days)
```lua
-- Minimal nvim integration
- HTTP client to Go backend
- Status line showing current session time
- File change detection
- Auto-start/pause based on nvim focus
```

**ROI Justification**: Cover your primary long-term editor

#### **2.4 Terminal Activity Tracking** (1-2 days)
```bash
# Simple shell hook integration
- Track command categories (git, npm, terraform, build tools)
- Duration and frequency per command type
- Integration with Go backend API
- Privacy-safe: command types only, not full commands or arguments
```

**ROI Justification**: Captures 20% of development time that happens outside IDEs (git, builds, deployments)

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- ✅ Sessions continue when switching VS Code → nvim
- ✅ Context recovery reduces to <30 seconds
- ✅ Accurate time tracking across all development tools
- ✅ Clear visibility into interruption costs
- ✅ Terminal work (git, builds, deployments) automatically tracked

---

## Phase 3: Intelligence & Insights + Browser Tracking (Week 5-8)
**ROI: MEDIUM-HIGH** | **Effort: Medium** | **Impact: Workflow Optimization**

### Core Goal: AI insights that actually change your behavior

#### **3.1 Pattern Analysis** (1 week)
```go
// Go backend AI engine
- Optimal focus time detection (when are you most productive?)
- Project complexity analysis (which tasks take longer than expected?)
- Interruption pattern identification (what time of day gets most interruptions?)
- Break timing optimization (when do you naturally pause?)
```

**ROI Justification**: Data-driven workflow optimization vs. guessing

#### **3.2 Repetitive Task Detection** (1 week)
```go
// Advanced tracking
- Track when you open docs/Stack Overflow repeatedly
- Detect similar file patterns you work on
- Identify research that happens multiple times
- Suggest automation opportunities
```

**ROI Justification**: Your specific request - identify tasks that should be automated/documented

#### **3.3 Enhanced Dashboard** (1 week)
```typescript
// React dashboard with insights
- Weekly productivity patterns (best times for deep work)
- Interruption cost analysis (how much time lost to context switching)
- Project velocity tracking (coding speed by project type)
- AI recommendations for workflow improvements
```

**ROI Justification**: Actionable insights vs. just raw data

#### **3.4 Browser Activity Tracking** (1 week)
```javascript
// Chrome and Firefox extensions
- Track development-related domains (GitHub, docs, Stack Overflow)
- Categorize: Research vs Tickets vs Documentation vs Distraction
- Privacy-first: whitelisted domains only, no content scraping
- Session correlation: research during which coding session?
- Local processing, no cloud data sharing
```

**ROI Justification**: Captures 30-40% of development time spent on research, ticket reviews, and documentation

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- ✅ Know your optimal focus times
- ✅ Identify 2-3 tasks that should be automated
- ✅ Data-driven decisions about when to schedule deep work
- ✅ Measurable reduction in repetitive research time
- ✅ Complete workflow coverage: IDE + terminal + browser activities tracked

---

## Phase 4: Polish & IntelliJ (Week 9-12)
**ROI: MEDIUM** | **Effort: Medium** | **Impact: Complete Workflow Coverage**

#### **4.1 IntelliJ Plugin** (2 weeks)
```java
// Complete IDE coverage
- Java development session tracking
- Integration with existing backend
- Project detection for enterprise Java work
```

#### **4.2 Advanced Features** (2 weeks)
```go
// Backend enhancements
- Export data to CSV/JSON
- Advanced pattern analysis
- Workflow optimization suggestions
- Self-hosted sync preparation
```

## **CRITICAL: Features NOT to Build**

### ❌ **Low ROI / High Effort**
- **Rigid timer controls**: You said existing timers don't work for flow
- **Social features**: You work solo, no team coordination needed yet
- **Mobile apps**: Your work happens on desktop IDEs
- **Complex gamification**: You want insights, not games
- **Manual task management**: You have existing tools for this
- **Calendar integration**: Adds complexity without solving core problems
- **Real-time collaboration**: Not your current pain point

### ❌ **Premature Optimization**
- **Multi-device sync**: Build for single machine first
- **Team features**: Solve personal workflow first
- **Advanced AI**: Start with basic pattern recognition
- **Custom timer algorithms**: Flow-based timing is already optimal
- **Extensive configuration**: Keep it simple initially

## Success Validation

### **Week 1: Basic Function**
- "I can see exactly how much time I spent coding today"
- "The timer doesn't interrupt my flow sessions"

### **Month 1: Workflow Integration**
- "I know which projects are taking longer than expected"
- "Context recovery is noticeably faster"

### **Month 2: Behavioral Change**
- "I schedule deep work during my most productive hours"
- "I've identified and automated 2-3 repetitive tasks"

### **Month 3: Optimization**
- "My workflow is measurably more efficient"
- "I have data-driven insights about my development patterns"

The key insight: **Start with automatic time tracking and flow preservation** - everything else is optimization on top of that foundation. Your current React app becomes the analytics engine, not the timer itself.
