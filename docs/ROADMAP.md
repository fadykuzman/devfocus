# DevFocus MVP Roadmap

**Target Ship Date: October 30, 2025 (4 weeks)**

## Current Status
- Timer mechanics (focus/break timers, start/pause/reset): âœ… **COMPLETED**

## Sprint 1: Core Functionality (October 1-7, 2025)
- [ ] **Oct 1-2**: Notifications (audio + browser notification)
- [ ] **Oct 3**: Timer completion handling - stop at 00:00 with clear state
- [ ] **Oct 4-5**: Basic session tracking - count completed sessions
- [ ] **Oct 6-7**: Essential keyboard shortcuts (space, R, F, B)

## Sprint 2: Persistence & UI Polish (October 8-14, 2025)
- [ ] **Oct 8-10**: State persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] **Oct 11-12**: Clear visual states (running/paused/completed/idle)
- [ ] **Oct 13-14**: Basic timer customization (adjust durations)

## Sprint 3: Reliability & Compatibility (October 15-21, 2025)
- [ ] **Oct 15-16**: Error recovery (browser refresh, tab close, sleep)
- [ ] **Oct 17-18**: Responsive design (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- [ ] **Oct 19-20**: Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- [ ] **Oct 21**: Offline functionality

## Sprint 4: Testing & Polish (October 22-28, 2025)
- [ ] **Oct 22-24**: Manual testing across all browsers/devices
- [ ] **Oct 25-26**: Bug fixes and critical issues
- [ ] **Oct 27**: Performance optimization
- [ ] **Oct 28**: Final polish and UX improvements

## Launch Preparation (October 29-30, 2025)
- [ ] **Oct 29**: Production deployment setup
- [ ] **Oct 30**: **ðŸš€ MVP LAUNCH**

## Testing Strategy (Reduced Approach)
- Critical path unit tests only for timer logic
- Manual testing for UI/UX flows
- Basic browser compatibility checks
- No comprehensive E2E suite initially

## Post-MVP (November 2025+)
Features deferred to validate MVP concept first:
- Advanced statistics and analytics
- Activity-specific timer suggestions
- IDE integrations (VSCode Extension)
- User authentication and profiles
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts
- Themes and dark mode

## Risk Mitigation
- **Week 1-2**: If behind, defer session tracking to post-MVP
- **Week 3**: If behind, simplify error recovery to basic refresh handling
- **Week 4**: If behind, launch with Chrome-only support initially

*Timeline assumes single developer, part-time development (20-25 hrs/week)*
