## Sprint 1: Core Privacy Infrastructure

### Issue #1: Basic Consent Management System

**Labels**: `privacy`, `gdpr`, `foundation`, `sprint-1`
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Priority**: High

#### Description
Implement a minimal consent management system that distinguishes between essential (required) and optional data collection for DevFocus timer functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for consent management
- [ ] Implement consent storage in encrypted localStorage
- [ ] Add first-run consent prompt UI component
- [ ] Distinguish between ESSENTIAL and SESSION_HISTORY consent types
- [ ] Provide consent withdrawal capability
- [ ] Include consent timestamp and version tracking

#### Technical Requirements
```typescript
// Example interfaces to implement
enum ConsentPurpose {
  ESSENTIAL = 'essential',
  SESSION_HISTORY = 'sessions'
}

interface ConsentRecord {
  purpose: ConsentPurpose;
  granted: boolean;
  timestamp: Date;
  version: number;
}
```

#### Implementation Notes
- Use React Context for consent state management
- Store consent decisions in encrypted localStorage
- Default to privacy-first (only essential consent granted)
- Consent prompt should be dismissible but re-appear until decided

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] Consent types defined and documented
- [ ] React hook `useConsent()` implemented
- [ ] First-run consent prompt displays correctly
- [ ] Consent decisions persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Consent can be withdrawn and re-granted
- [ ] Unit tests for consent management logic
- [ ] Integration test for consent workflow

### Issue #2: Encrypted Session Storage Implementation

**Labels**: `privacy`, `encryption`, `storage`, `sprint-1`
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: Issue #1

#### Description
Replace current localStorage session storage with encrypted storage that respects user consent and provides automatic data retention.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement AES-256-GCM encryption wrapper for localStorage
- [ ] Migrate existing timer session data to encrypted format
- [ ] Add automatic data expiration (30 days default)
- [ ] Respect consent status - no storage without SESSION_HISTORY consent
- [ ] Provide graceful fallback if encryption fails
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility during migration

#### Technical Requirements
- Use Web Crypto API for encryption
- Generate unique encryption key per browser session
- Implement automatic data purging for expired sessions
- Store encryption metadata alongside encrypted data
- Handle storage quota limits gracefully

#### Security Requirements
- Never store encryption keys in localStorage
- Use proper random IV for each encryption operation
- Validate data integrity on decryption
- Clear sensitive data from memory after use

#### Implementation Notes
```typescript
// Example storage interface
interface EncryptedStorageManager {
  store(key: string, data: any, purpose: ConsentPurpose): Promise<boolean>;
  retrieve(key: string, purpose: ConsentPurpose): Promise<any | null>;
  delete(key: string): Promise<boolean>;
  purgeExpired(): Promise<number>;
}
```

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] Encrypted storage wrapper implemented and tested
- [ ] Existing session data successfully migrated
- [ ] Storage respects consent decisions
- [ ] Automatic expiration working correctly
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show minimal impact (<100ms overhead)
- [ ] Error handling for encryption failures
- [ ] Unit tests for all encryption/decryption scenarios
- [ ] Manual testing across different browsers

## Sprint 2: Privacy UI and Data Rights

### Issue #3: Basic Privacy Settings UI

**Labels**: `ui`, `privacy`, `settings`, `sprint-2`
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Issues #1, #2

#### Description

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add "Privacy & Data" section to existing settings menu
- [ ] Display current consent status with toggle switches
- [ ] Show storage usage information (sessions stored, storage used)
- [ ] Provide clear explanations of what each consent enables
- [ ] Ensure immediate effect when toggling consent
- [ ] Follow existing DevFocus design patterns

#### UI Specifications
```
Settings Menu Addition:
├── Timer Durations

└── 🔒 Privacy & Data          ← NEW SECTION
    ├── Session History: [●○] On
    ├── Storage Used: 2.3 KB
    ├── [Export My Data]
    └── [Delete All Sessions]
```

#### Design Requirements
- Match existing DevFocus visual style
- Use clear, developer-friendly language
- Show real-time storage usage updates
- Provide immediate visual feedback for changes
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

#### Accessibility Requirements
- Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast support

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] Privacy settings component implemented
- [ ] Integration with existing settings menu
- [ ] Real-time consent toggle functionality
- [ ] Storage usage display with live updates
- [ ] Visual feedback for user actions

### Issue #4: Data Export and Deletion Rights

**Labels**: `privacy`, `gdpr`, `data-rights`, `sprint-2`
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Issues #1, #2, #3

#### Description
Implement GDPR-mandated rights to data access and deletion, allowing users to export their timer session data and completely delete stored information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement data export functionality (JSON format)
- [ ] Provide complete session data deletion capability
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Show clear success/error messages
- [ ] Ensure exported data is complete and readable
- [ ] Verify complete data removal after deletion

#### Data Export Requirements
- Export all user's timer session data in JSON format
- Include metadata: export date, version, data types included
- Generate secure download without server dependency
- Provide human-readable structure
- Include data explanation/schema

#### Data Deletion Requirements
- Complete removal of all session data
- Clear consent records for deleted data types
- Confirmation dialog with impact explanation
- Irreversible action with appropriate warnings
- Audit log entry (if audit logging implemented)

#### Example Export Format
```json
{
  "export_metadata": {
    "generated_at": "2025-10-02T14:30:00Z",
    "devfocus_version": "1.0.0",
    "data_types": ["timer_sessions", "user_preferences"]
  },
  "timer_sessions": [
    {
      "id": "session_123",
      "mode": "focus",
      "duration_seconds": 2400,
      "completed": true,
      "started_at": "2025-10-01T09:00:00Z",
      "ended_at": "2025-10-01T09:40:00Z"

  ],
  "user_preferences": {
    "focus_duration": 2400,
    "break_duration": 600,
    "theme": "default"
  }
}
```

- [ ] Data deletion removes all traces of session data
- [ ] Confirmation workflows prevent accidental deletion
- [ ] Success/error notifications display correctly
- [ ] Exported data validates against schema
