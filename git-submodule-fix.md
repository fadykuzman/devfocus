# Git Submodule Issue Resolution

## Problem

The `devfocus/` subdirectory was being treated as a git submodule instead of a regular directory within the main repository. This caused issues where:

- The directory appeared as a single commit reference instead of tracking individual files
- Git commands would fail with "fatal: in unpopulated submodule 'devfocus'" errors
- The subdirectory maintained its own separate git repository

## Root Cause

The `devfocus/` directory contained its own `.git` directory, making it a nested git repository. When git detected this, it automatically treated it as a submodule reference rather than tracking the actual files within the directory.

## Solution Steps

1. **Removed the cached submodule reference**:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached devfocus
   ```

2. **Deleted the nested git repository**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf devfocus/.git
   ```

3. **Added the directory as regular files**:
   ```bash
   git add devfocus/
   ```

4. **Committed the changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Convert devfocus from git submodule to regular directory"
   ```

## Result

- The `devfocus/` directory is now tracked as a regular directory
- All 29 files within `devfocus/` are individually tracked by git
- No more submodule-related errors when working with the directory
- The directory structure is now part of the main repository's history

## Files Affected

29 files were converted from submodule reference to individual file tracking, including:
- Source code files (React components, hooks, tests)
- Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Public assets and documentation
